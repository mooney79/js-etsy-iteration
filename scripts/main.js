/*
Requirements
Using the global items variable created in items.js, use array.map(), array.reduce(), array.forEach(), 
and array.filter() to help you through the assignment questions

The answers should be logged out to your console using console.log()

Make sure the output matches the answers below each question

Please comment your code as you walk through your process

It is suggested that you write functions that return values, not just functions that call console.log

};
totalCents = total * 100;
avgPrice = totalCents/items.length;
